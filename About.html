    <h1>About The Third Voice</h1>
  </header>
  <section>
    <p><strong>We’re not Left. We’re not Right. We’re Human.</strong></p>
    <p>The Third Voice is not a party. It’s not a person. It’s a pulse—rising in the hearts of those who know that truth is more than a slogan and power belongs to the people.</p>
    <p>Born from both vision and lived experience, The Third Voice began as a whisper—an idea passed between friends, then a calling that refused to be silenced.</p>
    <p>It’s for the 88 million eligible voters who didn’t cast a ballot in 2024.<br>
    It’s for those who haven’t seen themselves reflected in any candidate—so their only option was to vote for the one they believed would cause the least harm to their city, state, or country.<br>
    It’s for those who voted against their own truth to keep the peace in their lives.<br>
    It’s for those who’ve always voted, yet never truly felt represented.</p>
    <p><strong>You are The Third Voice.</strong></p>

    <h2>Our Mission Is Simple: Speak. Show Up. Shift the Story.</h2>
    <p>This isn’t about waking the masses with rage—it’s about <em>remembering</em> our humanity, reclaiming our agency, and rewriting what it means to belong in a democracy.</p>
    <p>There is no membership. No dues. No gatekeepers.<br><strong>The only requirement is being human.</strong></p>
