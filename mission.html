    <h1>Mission & Manifesto</h1>
  </header>
  <section>
    <p><strong>Our mission is simple:</strong> Speak. Show up. Shift the story.</p>
    <p>The Third Voice exists to awaken presence, amplify unheard truths, and return power to the human spirit. We are not a political party—we are a presence movement. We rise in the in-between spaces where silence once lived, and we fill them with our voice.</p>
    <p>This movement is a call to remember that we belong to one another. To remember we are more than voters—we are visionaries, protectors, neighbors, and changemakers. We were never meant to choose sides. We were meant to <strong>speak</strong>.</p>

    <h2>The Manifesto</h2>
    <p>The Third Voice is not a party. It is not a machine. It is not a hierarchy. It is not a protest in the traditional sense. It is a living thing. It moves like breath, like a wave, like music. It does not climb ladders—it unfolds in circles. It gathers instead of conquers. It remembers instead of erases.</p>
    <p>It begins by listening. Then, it speaks. And it sings. We are not here to lead you. We are here to remind you that you were never voiceless—only silenced. And now, we move as a collective chorus.</p>
    <p>There are four waves to this movement:
    <br><strong>1. Artists</strong> – to awaken emotion, reveal beauty, and make truth visible.
    <br><strong>2. Healers & Spiritual Guides</strong> – to tend our wounds, ground our courage, and build inner trust.
    <br><strong>3. Civic & Political Voices</strong> – to teach, inform, and dismantle the illusion of helplessness.
    <br><strong>4. Scholars & Legacy Builders</strong> – to blueprint the future and hold the memory of how we began.</p>
    <p>And all of it starts at home. We do not begin in Washington. We begin on your street. In your city. With your neighbor. With your self.</p>
    <p>Because real power does not trickle down—it rises from below. We vote Human. We move through presence. We speak with truth. We do not shout to be heard—we gather to be seen.</p>
    <p>This is not about winning arguments. This is about remembering we belong to one another. The system does not know what to do with something that does not want to rule—it only knows how to remake it.</p>
    <p>This is the quiet revolution. This is sacred rebellion. This is how the future will remember us.</p>
    <p><strong>We are The Third Voice. And we are rising.</strong></p>
