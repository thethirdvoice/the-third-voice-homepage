    <h2>What does The Third Voice actually do?</h2>
    <p>Right now, we listen to you. We help people see their own power by showing them the truth: they were never voiceless—only unheard. This movement is designed to reflect, resonate, and help others remember.</p><h2>Is this a political movement?</h2>
<p>It’s not partisan. But it is political—because existing in truth, and empowering people to reclaim their presence, is political. We don’t vote red or blue. We vote Human.</p>

<h2>Is this a protest movement?</h2>
<p>Not in the way you’re used to. We don’t block roads—we open eyes. We don’t scream—we resonate. When we gather, we do so like a celebration. A joyful, sacred presence. We challenge systems, not each other.</p>

<h2>Do I have to register?</h2>
<p>If you're human, this is your invitation. All you have to do is accept it.</p>

<h2>What if I’m not political?</h2>
<p>That’s okay. Many of us aren’t. The Third Voice is about being human first—before labels, before parties, before ideologies. You don’t have to be political to show up in truth.</p>
